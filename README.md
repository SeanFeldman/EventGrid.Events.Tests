# Azure Event Wishlist

Azure emits a variety of events to Azure Event Grid which allows you to extend and react to what's going on in your apps & infrastructure, but not everything is there yet.

**Azure Event Wishlist** is a dashboard that gathers all events that would be great to have in Azure!

## How can you help?

- **Propose new event suggestions** by opening a new issue
