# Azure Events Wishlist

Azure services emit a variety of events to Azure Event Grid, enabling you to extend and react to what's going on in your applications and infrastructure, although not all the events are there yet.

**Azure Event Wishlist** is a dashboard that gathers all events that would be great to have in Azure!

## How can you help?

- **Propose new event suggestions** by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/SeanFeldman/azure-events-wishlist/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=event-request.md&title=New+event+request)
- **Vote for the events** you'd like to see supported by giving a :+1: on the issues
- **Discuss events** to provide valuable information to the Microsoft service teams

## Examples

Here are some examples of how powerful Azure events can be:

- [Monitoring Key Vault with Azure Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/event-grid-overview) and automatically renew certificates that are about to expire.
- [Automate resizing uploaded images using Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/event-grid/resize-images-on-storage-blob-upload-event?tabs=dotnet)
